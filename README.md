# d-pad

d-pad (distractions pad) - small application works well with **Pomodoro technique**.  
This is micro notepad with the icon in a tray that **not save anything**.  
When you work for short periods with a high concentration it can be useful put distractive thoughts there.  
All text will be deleted after exit.  
It was also inspired by [Xpad](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/xpad/)  - app for Ubuntu.  
The app was built on Electron for **Ubuntu** and also works on **Windows** and **MacOS**.
